HFT Simulation Engine for MarketSentinel
Provides research-grade simulation skeletons for market making, VWAP/TWAP, and micro-momentum strategies.

NOTE: This is a simulation skeleton for research. Running live requires direct market access, co-location, and regulatory compliance. Do NOT use for production HFT.

HFT vs Simulation Documentation:
- Real HFT requires: co-location, direct market feeds (SIP/exchange), broker/exchange membership, FIX protocol, microsecond latency infra, and legal compliance.
- This module provides only research-grade simulation for algorithm development using public/minute data.
- Do NOT use for live trading or production HFT.
